Basic materials

A single .mtl file may define multiple materials. Materials are defined one after another in the file, each starting with the newmtl command:

# define a material named 'Colored'
newmtl Colored

The ambient color of the material is declared using Ka. Color definitions are in RGB where each channel's value is between 0 and 1.

# white
Ka 1.000 1.000 1.000

Similarly, the diffuse color is declared using Kd.

# white
Kd 1.000 1.000 1.000

The specular color is declared using Ks, and weighted using the specular exponent Ns.

# black (off)
Ks 0.000 0.000 0.000

# ranges between 0 and 1000
Ns 10.000

Materials can be transparent. This is referred to as being dissolved. Unlike real transparency, the result does not depend upon the thickness of the object. A value of 1.0 for "d" (dissolve) is the default and means fully opaque, as does a value of 0.0 for "Tr". Dissolve works on all illumination models.

# some implementations use 'd'
d 0.9
# others use 'Tr' (inverted: Tr = 1 - d)
Tr 0.1

Transparent materials can additionally have a Transmission Filter Color, specified with "Tf".

# Transmission Filter Color (using R G B)
Tf 1.0 0.5 0.5 
# Transmission Filter Color (using CIEXYZ) - y and z values are optional and assumed to be equal to x if omitted
Tf xyz 1.0 0.5 0.5 
# Transmission Filter Color from spectral curve file (not commonly used)
Tf spectral <filename>.rfl <optional factor>

A material can also have an optical density for its surface. This is also known as index of refraction.

# optical density
Ni 1.45000

Values can range from 0.001 to 10. A value of 1.0 means that light does not bend as it passes through an object. Increasing the optical density increases the amount of bending. Glass has an index of refraction of about 1.5. Values of less than 1.0 produce bizarre results and are not recommended.[7]

Multiple illumination models are available, per material. Note that it is not required to set a transparent illumination model in order to achieve transparency with "d" or "Tr", and in modern usage illum models are often not specified, even with transparent materials. The illum models are enumerated as follows:

0. Color on and Ambient off
1. Color on and Ambient on
2. Highlight on
3. Reflection on and Ray trace on
4. Transparency: Glass on, Reflection: Ray trace on
5. Reflection: Fresnel on and Ray trace on
6. Transparency: Refraction on, Reflection: Fresnel off and Ray trace on
7. Transparency: Refraction on, Reflection: Fresnel on and Ray trace on
8. Reflection on and Ray trace off
9. Transparency: Glass on, Reflection: Ray trace off
10. Casts shadows onto invisible surfaces
